    "\n",
    "A1: API stands for Application Programming Interface. It is a set of rules and protocols that allows different software applications to communicate with each other. An API specifies how software components should interact, defining the methods, data formats, and protocols that should be used. An example of an API used in real life is the Google Maps API. It allows developers to integrate Google Maps into their own applications, enabling them to display maps, geocode addresses, and perform various location-based operations.\n",

    "\n",
    "Promotes modularity: APIs allow developers to create modular applications by providing well-defined interfaces between different components.\n",
    "Encourages reusability: APIs facilitate code reuse, as developers can leverage existing APIs to add functionality to their applications without having to build everything from scratch.\n",
    "Enhances collaboration: APIs enable multiple developers or teams to work on different parts of an application simultaneously, as long as they adhere to the API specifications.\n",
    "Enables innovation: APIs provide a way for developers to access and integrate external services and data, allowing them to create new and innovative applications.\n",
    "Disadvantages of using API:\n",
    "\n",
    "Dependency on external services: When using external APIs, applications become dependent on the availability and reliability of those services. If an API goes down or undergoes changes, it can impact the functionality of the application.\n",
    "Lack of control: When relying on third-party APIs, developers have limited control over the inner workings of those APIs. They are bound by the specifications and updates provided by the API provider.\n",
    "Security concerns: Using APIs can introduce security risks, such as exposing sensitive data or allowing unauthorized access if not implemented and secured properly.\n",
    "Potential compatibility issues: APIs can evolve over time, introducing changes that might not be backward compatible. This can require developers to update their code to accommodate the changes.\n",

    "Q3. What is a Web API? Differentiate between API and Web API.\n",
    "A3: A Web API, also known as a web service API, is an API specifically designed to communicate over the internet using the HTTP protocol. It enables applications to interact with each other or access resources over a network. Web APIs are commonly used to expose functionality and data from server-side applications to client applications or other services.\n",

    "Difference between API and Web API:\n",
    "\n",
    "API: API is a broad term that encompasses various types of interfaces that allow software components to interact. It can refer to any interface, regardless of the underlying communication protocol or technology.\n",
    "Web API: Web API specifically refers to APIs that are designed to be accessed over the web using HTTP. Web APIs commonly follow the principles of Representational State Transfer (REST) architecture or use SOAP (Simple Object Access Protocol) for communication.\n"

    "A4:\n",
    "\n",
    "REST (Representational State Transfer): REST is an architectural style for building web services. It emphasizes scalability, simplicity, and interoperability between systems. RESTful APIs use standard HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) to perform operations on resources identified by URLs. They typically respond with data formatted as JSON or XML. REST APIs are stateless, meaning each request from the client contains all the information needed for the server to understand and process it.\n",
